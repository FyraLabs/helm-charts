# Fyra Labs Helm Charts

This is a collection of Helm charts made by Fyra Labs, initially for deploying our own services.

Most of these are forks of other charts, with some modifications to make them work for our use cases, and sometimes easier deployment.

## Usage

To use these charts, you need to add this repository to your Helm installation.
Currently, this helm chart is only available as a git repository.

After adding the repository, you can install the charts as you would any other chart.

Instructions are documented in the `README.md` files of each chart.
